****🧾 Shared Expense Manager****

A simple expense-sharing app built with Vanilla JS + LocalStorage, designed for me and my friend to easily track daily expenses, paybacks, and monthly balances.


**💡 Why this app?**

In our daily life, we often spend money for shared needs like groceries, meals, and rent. But it becomes confusing to remember:

~~Who paid more this month?

~~Who still owes money?

~~How much does each person need to contribute for rent and groceries?

~~What if someone pays back directly—how do we track that?

We needed a simple, lightweight, and offline-first solution that doesn’t depend on third-party apps or internet access. That’s why this app was created — to make our group expense management transparent, fair, and effortless.

With this app, we can:

~~Record every expense fairly.

~~Instantly see who owes or gets money.


****✨ Features****

~~Add Expenses – Record who paid and how much.

~~Fair Share Calculation – Automatically splits costs equally among 3 people.

~~Payback System – Track when someone pays another back.

~~Monthly Filter – View expenses and balances for any month.

~~Fixed Rent Cost – Adds 1000 TK/person (3000 TK total) automatically.

~~Summary Table – Shows per-person expenses + net balances.

💾 Export/Import – Backup all data as JSON and restore later.

~~LocalStorage Persistence – Data stays even after refreshing.

~~Delete Options – Remove individual or all expenses.

~~Keep track of monthly totals (including fixed rent).

~~Export/import backups without losing history.

This project is not just a tool — it’s our personal finance tracker for smooth living together without confusion or manual calculations.
